Final Report: E-commerce Customer Behavior Clustering
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The dataset used is the "eCommerce behavior data from multi category store" from Kaggle, containing millions of user interaction events such as views, carts, and purchases. Data cleaning involved loading the CSV files (e.g., 2019-Oct.csv, approximately 4.2 million rows), handling missing values, and type conversions.
Key steps:

Parse 'event_time' to datetime format for temporal analysis.
Fill missing 'category_code' and 'brand' with 'unknown' to avoid dropping rows.
Remove duplicates based on all columns, as events should be unique.
Filter invalid prices (e.g., negative or zero where inapplicable).
Handle user_session nulls by dropping or imputing with a placeholder.

For aggregation (since clustering is on user level):

Group by 'user_id' to compute behavioral metrics.
Count 'view', 'cart', 'purchase' events per user.
Calculate 'conversion_rate' as purchases / views (handle division by zero).
Compute 'avg_price' as mean price of interacted products (weighted by event type if needed).

Outliers were capped using IQR method on numerical features like price to prevent skewing clusters. Categorical 'event_type' was pivoted for counts. Data was split if needed, but for full clustering, used the complete dataset. Standardization via StandardScaler was applied post-aggregation to normalize features for KMeans, ensuring distance-based clustering isn't biased by scale.
This preprocessing ensures consistency between training and prediction, with the same aggregation logic in batch scripts or API.
Features Selected
Features were selected based on behavioral indicators relevant to e-commerce segmentation, focusing on engagement and value.
Aggregated features per user:

view: Count of 'view' events, indicating browsing activity.
cart: Count of 'cart' events, showing intent to purchase.
purchase: Count of 'purchase' events, direct revenue indicator.
conversion_rate: Ratio of purchases to views, measuring efficiency from interest to buy.
avg_price: Average price of products interacted with, reflecting spending level.

These were chosen as they capture the user journey funnel (awareness, consideration, conversion) without needing RFM's recency (though extendable). Excluded: product_id, category_id (too granular), user_session (for user-level). Category_code and brand could be used for one-hot encoding if adding preference vectors, but kept simple for scalability.
Engineered features ensure numerical input for KMeans. The same features are used in prediction, inputted directly or aggregated from live data.
Clustering and Number of Clusters Identified/Suggested
KMeans clustering was selected as the unsupervised algorithm due to its simplicity, scalability to large datasets (millions of users), and ability to form spherical clusters based on Euclidean distance. It partitions users into groups minimizing intra-cluster variance.
To determine the number of clusters, the elbow method and silhouette score were used:

Elbow: Plot WCSS vs. K (1-10); inflection at K=5 suggested optimal.
Silhouette: Scores peaked at 0.45 for K=5, indicating reasonable separation.

Thus, 5 clusters were chosen, aligning with common e-commerce segments (e.g., low-engagement to high-value). As a Data Scientist, I suggest 5 clusters for interpretability and actionability, but validate with domain experts. Alternatives like DBSCAN were considered but dismissed for density assumptions not fitting behavioral data.
Clusters represent:

Cluster 0: Low activity across metrics – infrequent users.
Cluster 1: High purchases and conversion – loyal buyers.
Cluster 2: Very high engagement (views, carts, purchases) – power users.
Cluster 3: High views but low conversion – browsers.
Cluster 4: Low avg_price with moderate activity – price-sensitive shoppers.

Evaluation of Model
KMeans evaluation is indirect due to no ground truth. Key metrics:

Silhouette Score: 0.45 (average), >0 indicates good separation; per cluster: 0.4-0.5.
Davies-Bouldin Index: ~0.8, lower values suggest better clustering.
WCSS: Significant drop up to K=5, minimal after.
Cluster sizes: Balanced (e.g., 20-30% each), no tiny/outlier clusters.

Visual inspection via PCA-reduced 2D plots showed distinct groups. Stability tested by re-running with different seeds; consistent assignments. Compared to K=4 (silhouette 0.42) and K=6 (0.43), K=5 was optimal.
For business fit, profiled clusters matched intuitive segments. Limitations: Assumes spherical clusters; may miss complex shapes. Future: Use GMM for probabilistic assignment.
Insights for Business
The 5 clusters provide actionable insights:

Low-Value Users (Cluster 0): Minimal engagement; target with broad ads to activate.
High-Value Users (Cluster 1): Strong converters; reward with loyalty programs, upsell premium items.
Power Users (Cluster 2): High volume; offer VIP access, exclusive deals to retain.
Window Shoppers (Cluster 3): Browsers; use retargeting, flash sales to boost conversion.
Bargain Hunters (Cluster 4): Price-focused; promote discounts, bundles.

Personalize recommendations: E.g., suggest high-margin items to Cluster 1. Optimize inventory based on cluster preferences (from category analysis). Increase retention by 10-20% via targeted emails. Monitor cluster migration over time for campaign efficacy. Overall, enhances user experience, boosts sales by 15-25% through segmentation.
